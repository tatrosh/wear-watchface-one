# wear-watchface-one
Simple watchface for Android wear, developed mainly for ZenWatch 2

Main reason for development is that I wanted simple black background watchface with numbers on ticks.

Development in progress, it will probably end up as various watch faces, who knows.

Currently does not provide more than simple analogue black background watchface with numbers on 3, 6, 9 and 12

Currently working on:
* nicer ticks

Queued: 
* smooth second hand
* view date (configurable if possible)
* ideas?
