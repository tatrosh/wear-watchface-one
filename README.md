# wear-watchface-one
Simple watchface for Android wear, developed mainly for ZenWatch 2

Main reason for development is that I wanted simple black background watchface with numbers on ticks.

Development in progress, it will probably end up as various watch faces, who knows :) Feel free to participate if you feel like it.

Currently does not provide more than simple analogue black background watchface with numbers on 3, 6, 9 and 12 marks.

Also, not yet really tested on real device, just on virtual one. Main focus should be aimed at testing notifications.

Current work and issues queued are managed here. Feel free to add more.
